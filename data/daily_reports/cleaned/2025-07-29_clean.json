        "summary": "Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of\nthe tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution\nfor aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain\nfundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,\nevolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are\nincreasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static\nnature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can\nadaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from\nscaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing\ninterest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and\nadaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the\nfirst systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized\naround three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how\nto evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,\nmodels, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages\n(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and\narchitectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,\ntextual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we\nanalyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,\nhighlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,\nand identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,\nscalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.",

Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due\nto their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and\naudio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint\ndelivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal\ninformation, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce\nARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual\nsignals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The\nmodel is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and\nsummarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,\nand video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation\npipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive\nregimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative\nevaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative\ncomparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video\ncomprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for\ndiverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our\nmodel has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and\nsatisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress\ntests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on\nH20 GPU.",

We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs\nnatively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:\nweak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our\ninnovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints\ninto design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure\ncombining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward\nnetworks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model\ncapacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for\nmemory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to\nslash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and\nSmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and\neven outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly\neliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both\nmodels exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB\nand 8GB of memory respectively.

In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency.

        "summary": "Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in\nphotographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing\nmethods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide\nessential geometric references and layout information for document image\ncorrection. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)\nto eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we\ninitially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts\ndetailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a\nforeground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable\nand background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to\nleverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the\ndistorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as\nDocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the\nproposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and\ntable borders.

These models are increasingly capable\nof generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and\nacoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative\naudio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open\nlyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an\nacceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,\nthese models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by\nmusicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our\nflow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing\nand duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.\nTo enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human\npreferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference\nOptimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,\neliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to\nstandardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public\nevaluation dataset JAME.

Soliciting human preferences via\nlistening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies\nare expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may\ndiffer across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align\ntheir TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and\nrenewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these\ngaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users\ninput text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,\nand their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena\nfollows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with\nkey features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the\nheterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*\npreferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also\npropose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a\nrenewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.\nThrough its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,\nand music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in\nthe TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully\nadapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.\n  Music Arena is available at: https://music-arena.org",

In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model\nreflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the\nfine-grained sample level.

        "summary": "When language models (LMs) are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to\ngenerate natural language \"reasoning chains\", their performance improves on a\nvariety of difficult question answering tasks. Today, almost all successful\napplications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the\ncorrectness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize\nguessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect\nof degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate\nincorrect responses (or \"hallucinate\") in other problem domains. This paper\ndescribes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach\nto training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated\nconfidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical\nconfidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward\nfunction that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a\nscoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction.\nWe first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that\nuses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both\naccurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR\nsubstantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain\nand out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and\nclassifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL\nhurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized\nconfidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration\nvia confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly\noptimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning\nmodels.",

To systematically evaluate these\ninterpreter-specific risks, we propose CIRCLE (Code-Interpreter Resilience\nCheck for LLM Exploits), a simple benchmark comprising 1,260 prompts targeting\nCPU, memory, and disk resource exhaustion. Each risk category includes\nexplicitly malicious (\"direct\") and plausibly benign (\"indirect\") prompt\nvariants. Our automated evaluation framework assesses not only whether LLMs\nrefuse or generates risky code, but also executes the generated code within the\ninterpreter environment to evaluate code correctness, simplifications made by\nthe LLM to make the code safe, or execution timeouts. Evaluating 7 commercially\navailable models from OpenAI and Google, we uncover significant and\ninconsistent vulnerabilities. For instance, evaluations show substantial\ndisparities even within providers - OpenAI's o4-mini correctly refuses risky\nrequests at 7.1%, notably higher rates compared to GPT-4.1 at 0.5%.
