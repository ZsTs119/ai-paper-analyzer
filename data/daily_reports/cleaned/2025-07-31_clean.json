        "summary": "Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end\ncode holds significant promise for accelerating software development and\ndemocratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,\nstructural coherence, and code correctness.

Unlike earlier Falcon\nmodels built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a\nparallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State\nSpace Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational\nefficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and\ntraining dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1\nis released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned\nvariants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized\ninstruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on\nHF Mirror Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and\nexceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B\nmatches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B,\nand Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models\nshow similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B\nmodels, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024.\nThese models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks,\ninstruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K\ncontext tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of\napplications.

        "summary": "3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to\ndeconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,\ncurrent 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring\nconsiderable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a\nnovel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing\nfor intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart\nof BANG is \"Generative Exploded Dynamics\", which creates a smooth sequence of\nexploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while\npreserving their geometric and semantic coherence.\n  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned\nfor exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing\nprecise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal\nattention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This\ninteraction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling\n2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.\n  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,\nassociating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating\ncomponent-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG\noffers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for\neasy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation\nfrom imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on\ncreation that resonates with human intuition.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models. Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of\ngradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning\nabilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically\nadjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a\ndynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively\nregulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing\nreasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented\nmodels across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,\nlogic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.",

This paper introduces Step-3, a\n321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for\nminimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel\nMulti-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces\nboth KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention\nexpressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed\ninference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers\ninto specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost\nefficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared\nwith models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at\nlonger context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per\ntoken (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that\nhardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are\ncritical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with\nDeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs\nachieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under\n50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324\nin the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.",

In this paper, we propose\nMixGRPO, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed\nsampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential\nequations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the\noptimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost\nperformance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using\nSDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while\napplying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the\ntime-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and\nallowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.\nAdditionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in\noptimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a\nfaster variant, termed MixGRPO-Flash, which further improves\ntraining efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits\nsubstantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,\noutperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%\nlower training time.

Existing techniques for APR are\noften combined with LLMs (Large Language Models), which leverages the\ncode-related knowledge of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. Current\nLLM-based APR methods typically utilize test cases only during the inference\nstage, adopting an iterative approach that performs repair first and validates\nit through test execution afterward. This conventional paradigm neglects two\nimportant aspects: the potential contribution of test cases in the training\nphase, and the possibility of leveraging testing prior to repair. To address\nthis, we propose Repair-R1, which introduces test cases into the model's\ntraining phase and shifts test generation to precede repair. The model is\nrequired to first generate discriminative test cases that can distinguish\ndefective behaviors, and then perform repair based on these tests.

Differentially private stochastic\ngradient descent (DP-SGD) guarantees formal privacy, yet it does so at a\npronounced cost: gradients are forcibly clipped and perturbed with noise,\ndegrading sample efficiency and final accuracy. Numerous variants have been\nproposed to soften this trade-off, but they all share a handicap: their control\nknobs are hard-coded, global, and oblivious to the evolving optimization\nlandscape. Consequently, practitioners are forced either to over-spend privacy\nbudget in pursuit of utility, or to accept mediocre models in order to stay\nwithin privacy constraints. We present RLDP, the first framework to cast DP\noptimization itself as a closed-loop control problem amenable to modern deep\nreinforcement learning (RL). RLDP continuously senses rich statistics of the\nlearning dynamics and acts by selecting fine-grained per parameter\ngradient-clipping thresholds as well as the magnitude of injected Gaussian\nnoise. A soft actor-critic (SAC) hyper-policy is trained online during language\nmodel fine-tuning; it learns, from scratch, how to allocate the privacy budget\nwhere it matters and when it matters. Across more than 1,600 ablation\nexperiments on GPT2-small, Llama-1B, Llama-3B, and Mistral-7B, RLDP delivers\nperplexity reductions of 1.3-30.5% (mean 5.4%) and an average 5.6% downstream\nutility gain. RLDP reaches each baseline's final utility after only 13-43% of\nthe gradient-update budget (mean speed-up 71%), all while honoring the same\n(epsilon, delta)-DP contract and exhibiting equal or lower susceptibility\nto membership-inference and canary-extraction attacks.",

        "summary": "Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for\napplications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle\nwith automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present\nDreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene\ngeneration from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning\nmodule, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to\nconstruct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a\nstructured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern\nSampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and\nreconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure\nglobal consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy\ntailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports\nfine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and\n4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior\nmethods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution\nfor open-domain 3D content creation.
