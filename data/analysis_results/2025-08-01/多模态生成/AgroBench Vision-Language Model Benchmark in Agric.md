**英文摘要**：
Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

**技术特点**：AgroBench是首个由农业专家标注的视觉语言模型基准测试，覆盖7个农业主题、203个作物类别和682个疾病类别，提供更细粒度的分类体系评估VLM性能。研究揭示了现有模型在精细识别任务上存在明显不足，特别是在杂草识别方面表现接近随机水平，为未来VLM发展提供了明确改进方向。

**应用场景**：农作物疾病诊断系统，通过VLM自动识别作物病害，帮助农民及时采取防治措施；杂草精准识别与控制系统，区分作物和杂草实现精准除草，减少农药使用；农业教育培训工具，帮助农业专业人员和学生学习和识别不同作物和病害特征。
